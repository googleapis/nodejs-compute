# Google Compute Engine: Node.js Samples

[![Open in Cloud Shell][shell_img]][shell_link]

[Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/) lets you create and run virtual machines on Google infrastructure. Compute Engine offers scale, performance, and value that allows you to easily launch large compute clusters on Google&#x27;s infrastructure. There are no upfront investments and you can run thousands of virtual CPUs on a system that has been designed to be fast, and to offer strong consistency of performance.
